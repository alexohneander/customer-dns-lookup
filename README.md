# customer-dns-lookup
This tool goes through the letsencrypt domains and checks whether the respective domains still point to the correct system.

### Usage
Add your IP addresses under "config/default.json".
Then you can run the script and see which addresses point to the wrong IP and which cannot be resolved at all.
